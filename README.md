Data Science Internship Project - Restaurant Rating Prediction using EDA, Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning
 📌 Restaurant Rating Prediction
🔍 Overview
This project was developed as part of a **Data Science internship task**, where the objective was to analyze, visualize, and predict restaurant ratings using a real-world dataset. The dataset includes details like restaurant names, cuisines, locations, price range, ratings, online delivery, and table booking availability.

💡 Problem Statement
To extract meaningful insights from restaurant data and build predictive models to estimate the **aggregate rating** of a restaurant based on various features like cuisine type, cost, city, service options, etc.
